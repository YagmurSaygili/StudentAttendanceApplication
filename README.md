# StudentAttendanceApplication

An intermediate approach in C language to design Student Attendance System. Hash tables and open addressing used in the assigment

Intermediate C approach with using hash tables: open addressing
    to design Student Attendance System for schools

    Avaliable operations:
        1) Add student
        2) Search Student
        3) Print Student

    There is also an option for quadratic probing or double hashing before the
    system starts to design hash mapping. System asks user which way of hashing
    wanted then calculate accordingly.
